            I'm Hung Nguyen, currently a sophomore at LUT University, Finland.
            My journey into the world of technology began with a strong passion
            for problem-solving, which led me to pursue Competitive Programming
            at a very beginning of my high school. Through the years, I
            developed a solid foundation for coding and logical thinking, which
            later helps me to adapt well and thrive quickly in the University
            years. I consider myself as a discipline, patient, hard-working
            developer and really look for Front-end/ React/ Full-stack web
            development position. Please feel free to get in touch with me
